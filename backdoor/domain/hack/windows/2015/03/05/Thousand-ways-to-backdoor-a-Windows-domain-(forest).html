<meta name="description" content="When the Kerberos elevation of privilege (CVE-2014-6324 / MS14-068) vulnerability has been made public, the remediation paragraph of the following blog post made some waves:http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2014/11/18/additional-information-about-cve-2014-6324.aspx&quot;The only way a domain compromise can be remediated with a high level of certainty is a complete rebuild of the domain.&quot;Personally, I agree with this, but .... But whether this is the real solution, I&#39;m not sure. And the same applies to compromised computers. When it has been identified that malware was able to run on the computer (e.g. scheduled scan found the malware), there is no easy way to determine with 100% certainty that there is no rootkit on the computer. Thus rebuilding the computer might be a good thing to consider. For paranoids, use new hardware ;)But rebuilding a single workstation and rebuilding a whole domain is not on the same complexity level. Rebuilding a domain can take weeks or months (or years, which will never happen, as the business will close before that).There are countless documented methods to backdoor a computer, but I have never seen a post where someone collects all the methods to backdoor a domain. In the following, I will refer to domain admin, but in reality, I mean Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and Schema Admins.Ways to backdoor a domainSo here you go, an incomplete list to backdoor a domain:Create a new domain admin user. Easy to do, easy to detect, easy to remediateDump password hashes. The attacker can either crack those or just pass-the-hash. Since KB2871997, pass-the-hash might be trickier (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2871997), but not impossible. Easy to do, hard to detect, hard to remediate - just think about service user passwords. And during remediation, consider all passwords compromised, even strong ones.Logon scripts - modify the logon scripts and add something malicious in it. Almost anything detailed in this post can be added :DUse an already available account, and add domain admin privileges to that. Reset its password. Mess with current group memberships - e.g. http://www.exploit-db.com/papers/17167/Backdoor any workstation where domain admins login. While remediating workstations, don&#39;t forget to clean the roaming profile. The type of backdoor can use different forms: malware, local admin, password (hidden admin with 500 RID), sticky keys, etc.Backdoor any domain controller server. For advanced attacks, see Skeleton keys Backdoor files on network shares which are commonly used by domain admins by adding malware to commonly used executables - Backdoor factoryChange ownership/permissions on AD partitions - if you have particular details on how to do this specifically, please commentCreate a new domain user.

Redirect the traffic, enforce authentication, grab password hashes, ???, profit.Create high privileged users in applications running with high privileges, e.g. MSSQL, Tomcat, and own the machine, impersonate users, grab their credentials, etc. The typical pentest path made easy.Remove patches from servers, change patch policy not to install those patches.Steal Windows root/intermediate CA keysWeaken AD security by changing group policy (e.g. re-enabling LM-hashes)Update [2015-09-27]: I found this great presentation from Jakob Heidelberg.
